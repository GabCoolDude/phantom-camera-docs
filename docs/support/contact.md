## Community Support
If there's something about the addon you're unsure about or can't quite work out, then feel free to make a [discussion post on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/ramokz/phantom-camera/discussions/), you're likely not the only person who has had a particular question. Remember, there are **_no_** stupid questions!

## Direct Messages
Feel free to reach out to me ([ramokz](https://github.com/ramokz)) personally on any of the platforms below.<br>

Keep in mind that any technical, or code, related support is very limited due to code formatting not being a thing on those services. So use these for more general inquiries.

### Some minor house rules when asking for help
- Always be polite and respectful.
- Try to only ask questions concerning this addon. General Godot questions can be better answered in dedicated communities where more members are active in.
- Always check existing, and closed, issues before making a post.
    - If a question sounds similar to another post, then feel free to make a new one with a link to the previous one. Issues can always be closed. This is just to avoid having 100 posts about the same question if the answer is already there.
- Be as specific as possible and, if you can, include a minimal reproducible project (see [Godot's guideline description for more context](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#provide-a-simple-example-project)). Much like typical IT troubleshooting, it's difficult to help without seeing how you've done things.
- Lastly, this project is free, open-source and currently maintained by a single individual so don't expect a response nor fix right away.
